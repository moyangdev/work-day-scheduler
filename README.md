# Work Day Scheduler
## Bootcamp Challenge 05: Third-Party APIs

<b>User Story:</b><br />
AS AN employee with a busy schedule<br />
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br />
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively<br />

<b>Acceptance Criteria:</b><br />
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br />
WHEN I open the planner<br />
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br />
WHEN I scroll down<br />
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br />
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br />
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br />
WHEN I click into a time block<br />
THEN I can enter an event<br />
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br />
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br />
WHEN I refresh the page<br />
THEN the saved events persist<br />
